### Current Objective:

Be able to upload photos.

Be able to see photos uploaded.

Be able to delete previously uploaded photos.

Make love.

Be able to play a video that has been uploaded.

In the User.js, combine the method for giving the image preview.


#### Security Concerns

Linking to FontAwesome CDN. Not a big deal, they are pretty trusted, but would need to remove eventually, or have directly on the website.


#### Libraries to Add

https://uppy.io/ looks pretty cool. Good multi file upload format.


#### Nice to Haves / Maybe's

Restyle the file input names, so the regular one is hidden and I can display the text wrapped. Unless I go with the upload library.

What about encrypting information in the browser before sending it out? That way it never even touches my server. But if I do this, how will I be able to see the information to verify it? I can't exactly encrypt it on the browser... then how would I verify the the info. Mhmmm... I suppose I could call them and get the password over the phone, and they'd just have to trust that I'm not saving it. But at least that way if the server is comprised, it's not a big deal. I could do all my verification on a seperate computer that only accesses the information, but isn't directly connected to the internet otherwise.

Lol, I'm imagining the physical security of scanning volunteers, and having the computers they work on physically locked down, and all the computers physically innacessible from them, they just interact with the mouse and keyboard.

This is an interesting approach: https://www.noteshred.com/client-side-encryption
It also mentions the downsides of client side encryption.
