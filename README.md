# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

But instead I'm gonna use it as a planning document.

TODO: Create object for storing email addresses for peeps who aren't Canadian, but are interested.
  TODO: Import Country Gem - so that there's a standardized list of countries.
